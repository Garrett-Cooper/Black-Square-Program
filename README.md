# Black-Square-Program
If you like classical paintings, you may be familiar with the famous painting called Black Square, 
created by Kazimir Malevich in 1915. Since computers did not exist in the early twentieth century, 
the artists of that time had to paint squares by hand, but now anyone can produce squares automatically using a computer.


Input and Output:  This program takes two integer inputs, m and n, and draws m^2 squares, each of the size n x n, arranged in an m x m table. 
That is, it draws a table with m rows and m columns, each element of which is an n × n square. 

For example, if the input integers are 6 and 4, it draws 16 squares, each of the size 6 × 6, arranged in a 4 × 4 table. 
The perimeter of each square is composed of the symbol “*” (asterisk), and the space inside is filled with the symbol “o”.
